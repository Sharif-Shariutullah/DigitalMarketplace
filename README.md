# Digital Marketplace

Digital Marketplace is a web application built with Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. This repository contains the source code for the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital-Marketplace.git
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a new MySQL database named `digital_marketplace`.
2. Import the database schema from `src/main/resources/database/digital_marketplace.sql`.

### Backend Setup

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
3. Update the database connection properties (`spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, `spring.datasource.password`) according to your MySQL configuration.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install Angular CLI globally if not already installed:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### File Upload Configuration

1. Navigate to `src/main/java/com/example/digitalmarketplace/config/FileStorageProperties.java`.
2. Update the `uploadDir` property to your desired file upload directory.

### Important Notice

In the database, ensure that the product images' file path in the `Products` service ends with a trailing `/`. This is crucial for proper image retrieval.

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend Spring Boot application.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
